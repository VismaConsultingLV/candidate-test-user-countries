# Spring Boot Task: User Countries

This task is designed to evaluate your skills in **Spring Boot**, **JPA**, **WebClient**, and **Liquibase**. You will be working with an existing database schema and implementing business logic to fetch users' favorite countries along with detailed country data from an external API (https://restcountries.com/).

## Task Overview:

You will implement a **GET endpoint** to retrieve a user's favorite countries and integrate it with an external API to fetch country details like name, code, and capital city.

---

### Tasks:

#### 1. Retrieve Favorite Countries by User ID:
- **Implement a GET endpoint** that returns a **list of favorite countries** for a user based on their `userId`.
    - Each **UserEntity** has a `Set<CountryEntity>` representing the user's favorite countries.
    - The list should contain **country names**, **country codes**, and **capital cities**.

- **Use the existing repositories** to fetch the **user** and their associated **favorite countries**:
    - The `UserRepository` will provide access to the user.
    - The **favorite countries** are stored as a **many-to-many relationship** between users and countries.

- **WebClient Integration**:
    - **WebClient** should be used to **fetch detailed data** about the countries (name, code, capital) from the **REST Countries API**.
    - You should implement a **WebClient service** that makes a request to the API and retrieves the required country details for each country linked to the user.

#### 2. Liquibase Changelog:
- **Add a Liquibase changelog** to insert a **new user** and their **favorite countries** into the database.
    - The changelog should:
        - Insert a **new user** with a unique `id` and `username`.
        - Link the user to at least **two countries** using the `favorite_country` junction table.

### Example Data:
- **User**:
    - `id`: 4
    - `username`: `alice_smith`

- **Countries**:
    - `Germany` (code `DE`)
    - `France` (code `FR`)

### Submission Instructions:
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Implement** the `GET /users/{userId}/favorite-countries` endpoint in the controller and service layer.
3. **Implement** the `WebClient` method to fetch country data from the external API (name, code, capital).
4. **Create** a **Liquibase changelog** to insert a new user and link them to at least two favorite countries.
5. **Push** your changes to your repository.
6. During the video call, weâ€™ll walk through your implementation and discuss your approach.
